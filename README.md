# React Universal Tutorial

This tutorial is designed to land you in a familiar place<sup>1.</sup>—but also to get you introduced to a bunch of new front-end technologies. I appreciate the hundreds<sup>2.</sup> of starter kits that came before, and all of the hard work that went into the bleeds, but I wanted to understand why.

The overarching goal of this repository is to provide some basic, digestible, leverage—so you can continue your research of learning all the things—or do whatever you want.

## Summary

So you probably are sitting there with your head in your hands… and you have 20 tabs open. I am so very sorry, but this is the current state of web. Hopefully, as you go through each step, look through each folder, you will slowly gain more insight to where we find ourselves today.

After you slowly demystify Webpack, Babel, and the like, building components will become more predictable/enjoyable.

And if this wasn't enough bleeds for you… Please check out the [SUMMARY](https://github.com/chemoish/react-universal-tutorial/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).
